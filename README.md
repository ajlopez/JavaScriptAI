# JavaScript and Artificial Intelligence

Samples and demos of JavaScript Artificial Intelligence.

AI is a broad term, but it is the better I known.

The samples are for Node.js and for browser. The covered topics (Work in Progress):

- Tree Evaluation
- Neural Networks
- Genetic Algorithms
- Evolutionary Programming
- Hybrid Approach
- Machine and Deep Learning
- Decision Trees
